RAdwordsPlus is an extension to the RAdwords package by Johannes Burkhardt.
    The main feature of RAdwordsPlus is an API to connect to some of the RAdwords services.
    Currently only part of the Managed Customer, Targeting Idea and Traffic Estimator are availables.
    There's also a simplified version of the reporting API of RAdwords.
    RAdwords can be found on CRAN and at http://jburkhardt.github.io/RAdwords.
